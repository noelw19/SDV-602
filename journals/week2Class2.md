# Class 2

## redirect input from file using script
python3 data_scan.py < data.csv

each row will be converted to dictionary
dictionary in python is similar to json in JS

python3 data_scan.py --header < data_with_header.csv

header arguement when added turns first row into header and the rest will be viewed as data rows.

solve data spay routine so it doesnt make space between data (remove whitespace)

talk about argpass and what it does?
