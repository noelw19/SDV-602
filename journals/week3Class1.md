# Week 3 Class 1 - Monday

Today I was a little late for class, when i arrived the class was working on a task which included showing an example of the types of python data structures, 

The types asked to work on were as follows:

1. str()
2. tuple()
3. list()
4. set()
5. range()

### A few things i learnt today:
1. you are able to use the range method to populate a list.
2. A tuple is immutable unlike a list

Data structures - The shape of things to come.

Different data structures have different builtin methods that allow manipulation of the data within.

Iterables are values that you are able to iterate over within a data structure, in a certain sequence, so that the same index number will pull the same value.

s.count("a") - total occurances of "a" in "aardvark"

Set() only stores a specficied value once, does not have multiple strictly equal values, will remove the rest of the strictly equal copies and only leave the unique values.

Dictionaries are the only mapping type within python, {"Noel": "Student", "Todd": "Tutor"}.

\ <--- the slash within python shows that the code after the slash should be rendered in a new line.
