# Week 1 Class 2 - Dr Todd

this week we should have a go at using python in interpreted mode, by the end of today should have python installed.

python uses indentation instead of code blocks unlike javascript

### How to compare programming systems, data sources for our project.

programming paradigms 

by monday write blog entry with project details.

programming paradigm - is an approach to programming a computer based on a mathmatical theory or a coherent set of principals.

1. Object Oriented Prog - Best for problems with large number of related data abstractions organised in a hierarchy.

2. Logic Programming - is best for transforming or navigating complex symbolic structures according to local rules

3. Discrete Synchronous Programming - is best for reactive programs.

Paradigms
Imperative, Object-Oriented, Functional, Logic

functional programs do not store data they manipulate data and return the results.

Logic programming - is creating a set of rules, 

#### Imperative:
-has states representing memory cells with changing values.
-sequential orders 

#### Object-Oriented:
-Abstract data type definitions
-inheritence - defines an abstract data type derived from a parent type.
-inclusion-ploymorphism - allows a variable to refer to an object of a class or obj of any of its derived classes.
-polymorphic functions - the identity of a function applied to a polymorphic variable is resolved dynamically based on the type of the object reffered to by the variable.

#### Functional Paradigm
- is characterized by the programming with values, functions and functional forms. an important feature is reducing or eleminating the impact of side effects.

execution of functional programs is based on 2 fundamental mechanisms
1. Binding - is used to associate values with names
2. Application - is used to compute new values.

3 main function components
1. Data Objects
2. 

#### Logic Programming
this style emphasizes the declaritive description of a problem rather than the decomposition of the problem into a 

## Types (-ing) Syntax too
1. Strongly typed
2. Weakly typed
3. Dynamicly typed
4. Static typed

Syntax differences
python not using curly braces
no need for semi-colons
if condition : codeblock
+= is available
++ is not
